    <h4>My Favorite Hobby</h4>

    <p>I've Had a love for hunting and the outdoors as long as I can remember. It was difficult in the beginning <br>
        because nobody else in my family shared the same hobby. As I grew and learned it turned into a real passion of mine. <br>
        I taught myself and became very skilled in the sport. In my time hunting, I've hunted various types of wild game in <br>
        several states, but mostly North Carolina and Utah. In between hunting seasons I spend my time hiking to gather deer and elk <br>
        sheds, and hunting open season game such as Coyotes.
